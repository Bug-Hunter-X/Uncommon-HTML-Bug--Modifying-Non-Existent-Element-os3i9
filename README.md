This repository demonstrates a peculiar HTML/JavaScript bug involving an attempt to modify the innerHTML of a non-existent element. The bug.html file showcases the error, while bugSolution.html provides the corrected version.  The error arises from trying to access and modify an element (myDiv2) before it exists in the DOM. The solution involves ensuring the element is present before attempting to manipulate it, or handling the potential error using try...catch.
